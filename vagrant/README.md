# Installing Vagrant
You will need
-   Vagrant [(HashiCorp)][vagrant install]
-   VirtualBox [(Oracle)][virtualbox install]
-   VirtualBox Extensions [(Oracle)][virtualbox install]
-   A working Git installation & SSH client ([Cygwin][] or [Git for Windows][]
    work well on Windows, otherwise consult your OS package manager)

The Vagrantfile is split into 3 parts:
-   `Vagrantfile`: Deals with general VM configuration. (Mostly) project
    independent, should rarely require editing.
-   `Vagrantfile.project`: Deals with installing project-level tools and
    dependencies. This should not include user-specific settings.
-   `Vagrantfile.local`: Deals with user preferences and machine-specific
    settings. As this is intended to be user-specific, Git will ignore this
    file. A template (`Vagrantfile.local.example`) is included, and will be
    copied to `Vagrantfile.local` the first time you run `vagrant up`.

To boot the VM, navigate to the Vagrant folder (`<project>/Vagrant`) and run the
following commands from a terminal/command prompt:
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
That's it! The first `vagrant up` will likely take a few minutes while all
prerequisites are installed. Any `vagrant up` calls from a halt or suspend will
take significantly less time.

To power down, suspend, or kill the VM, run any of the following:
-   `vagrant suspend`: Pause VM, free resources. Fast startup, needs extra disk
    space.
-   `vagrant halt`: Shut VM down. Slow-ish startup, minimal disk space.
-   `vagrant destroy`: Wipe all traces of VM from system.

##### SSH Keys
If you use SSH keys to log in to GitHub, edit your `Vagrantfile.local` to load
them by modifying `$ssh_key_location` and `$ssh_public_key`. If your VM is
already running, typing `vagrant provision` will re-provision the machine
in-place. You will need to start the SSH agent and add your key for Vagrant to
recognize it by running the following commands:
```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add <ssh_private_key_location>
```

##### Common issues
-   **Vagrant commands won't work:**
    -   Ensure virtualization extensions are enabled (you may need to check
        your BIOS).
-   **git fetch/push/pull/etc. keep asking for credentials:**
    -   Either use a credential helper within the Vagrant machine or connect to
        Github with SSH.
-   **git status on (Vagrant/Cygwin/Windows) shows all files as modified, but
    nothing has changed:**
    -   The easiest solution to this is to remove the Git for Windows line
        ending filter from your `.gitconfig` file and configure your text
        editor to use `\n` for line endings.
